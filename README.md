Node.js Portfolio Generator

User Story:
AS A product manager

I WANT a developer profile generator

SO THAT I can easily prepare reports for stakeholders

Features:
Generate an HTML profile for a Github user by only typing their username
4 different color configurations are used 

Instructions:
Download and open the index.js file
Ensure you have node fetch, inquirer, and fs installed in your terminal
code is initialized by typing 'node index' into the terminal
User is prompted to choose between four different color options, which will determine 
the color scheme of the profile
User is then prompted to input their github Username
	If the username does not exist, an error message is displayed and the file will not 
	contain the requested information
	If the username does exist, no error message will display and the results will be 
	written to profile.html
	
Known issues:
I tried to follow along with the suggested styling, however I was unable to determine
what some of the styling elements were used for, so they have not been implemented in
the generated profile.
